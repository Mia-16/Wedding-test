  <h2> FAQs</h2>
<button class="accordion">Can I bring a plus one? </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Unfortunately, due to budget and space limitations, we simply canâ€™t afford for all of our lovely guests to bring a guest of their own.

Therefore, we regretfully ask our guests to please not bring a plus one, unless we have specifically invited them. Thank you so much for understanding!</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Is it okay to take pictures with our phones and cameras during the wedding?
</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes! We would love for you to take photos and share them with us!
However, please refrain from taking photos during the ceremony..</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What should I wear?
</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Our dress code is formal, however please make sure you wrap up warm in case it's a cold day! 

We would recommend packing some swimwear if you're brave enough to join us for a swim on Sunday! </p>
